Analyze the git history, specifically merge requests and their commits, to identify fixes, features, and other changes.

Based on this analysis, create or update the `CHANGELOG.md` file.

Reference `android/app/build.gradle` to determine the current app version for the changelog entry.

If `CHANGELOG.md` does not exist, create it by analyzing the entire repository history from the beginning.

The changelog should start with a tabular summary providing a high-level overview, followed by detailed, version-specific change descriptions.
